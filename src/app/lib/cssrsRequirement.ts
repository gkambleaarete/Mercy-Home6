// C-SSRS Full-Lifetime requirement VISIBILITY (US 20139, Chunk 5A).
//
// Explicit rule for this increment: a saved Risk Factor of "Suicidal
// Ideation" OR "Self-Harm" (exact match; "Self Harm" is accepted as an exact
// legacy alias) indicates that a C-SSRS Full-Lifetime is required. Nothing
// is matched by substring or read from narrative text.
//
// Deliberately NOT here (unresolved policy — see guidelines/cssrs-foundation.md):
// past-year suicidal thoughts/attempts, which action is blocked, which saved
// assessment satisfies the requirement, and reassessment. This module never
// reports a requirement as "satisfied", never changes a status and never
// calculates risk.
