// Seeded (pre-wizard) Friends First mentors — FF-CB-101 … — presented as
// shared Mentor Application records, so every Applications row opens the one
// record view. Pure and read-only: nothing here is written to storage, ids
// are the seeded ids, and a saved edit (staff processing keyed by the same
// id) always wins over these defaults.
//
// Only what the seeded mentor actually holds is carried over. What it does
// not hold stays empty (the record's own empty states) — no references,
// uploads, signatures, history or coordinator are invented.
//
// Deliberately NOT part of listFFMentorApplications(): these mentors were
// never submitted through the wizard, so they are not offered to the Mentor
// Search directory rules or the Mentor Match picker, which keep their
// existing eligibility checks unchanged.
