// Interview Summary for a Friends First Mentor Application (US 20039
// Chunk 3). One definition source for every interview question: stable
// explicit ids (never the display text or array position), the section, the
// wording, the input type, which sub-programs it applies to, and when it is
// required. The Interview Summary UI and the store's validation both use
// `applicableInterviewQuestions` — there is one applicability rule.
//
// Interview answers are staff-recorded and kept separate from the
// applicant's submitted answers; identical wording under different sections
// is a distinct entry with its own id.
