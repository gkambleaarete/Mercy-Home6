// Mentor Search directory (US 19877) — mentors who have entered the mentoring
// program, as opposed to ffMentorCandidates.ts, which selects who can be
// offered a NEW match. The match-candidate selector and its safety gates are
// not touched: a mentor can be in the directory and still be ineligible for a
// new match.
//
// A directory member is, on the canonical mentor identity (applicant id):
//   - not Inactive (the shared mentor-level availability decision), and
//   - on at least one application with the saved applicant status Approved
//     (applicantStatus === "approved" — the explicit saved approval), at a
//     saved stage of Ready for Match, Matched or Active.
// The stage is an onboarding filter, never approval evidence, and a status is
// never inferred from a stage. The current readiness checklist is NOT a
// membership condition: an approved mentor whose requirement later fails or
// becomes unknown stays listed, carrying a readiness warning for staff.
