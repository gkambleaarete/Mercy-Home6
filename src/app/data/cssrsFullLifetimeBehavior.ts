// C-SSRS Full-Lifetime, Section 3 (Suicidal Behavior) and Section 4 (Attempt
// Details and Lethality) — US 20139. Content, normalization and validation
// as pure functions, shared by the editing components, the read-only
// components and the save boundary. Sections 1–2 live in cssrsFullLifetime.ts
// and are never touched here.
//
// Assumptions (prototype):
//  • "If Yes, Describe" narratives are optional (as in Sections 1–2).
//  • Counts: for Actual / Interrupted / Aborted / Preparatory, Yes requires a
//    positive WHOLE number. No saves 0 (and clears the description);
//    unanswered stays null (never 0). Negative, fractional or non-numeric
//    entries are rejected, never rounded or coerced.
//  • Non-suicidal self-injury is Yes/No only (no description or count) and
//    never triggers Section 4.
//  • Section 4 applies when Actual Attempt = Yes in EITHER period and nothing
//    else. When it applies, the date and Actual Lethality code are required in
//    all three groups (prototype completion rule). Potential Lethality is
//    required only when that group's Actual Lethality is 0. The same event may
//    fill several groups; nothing decides which attempt was most lethal.
//  • Nothing is inferred from narrative text or from another response.
//  • Actual Attempt asks nine questions. Question 1 is the explicit Actual
//    Attempt response (behavior.actualAttempt) and alone drives Section 4 and
//    the totals; Questions 2–9 are independent Yes/No + description pairs per
//    period (actualAttemptQuestions), keyed by stable ids. A Yes count is
//    never derived from how many questions were answered Yes.
//  • "What did you do?" is asked as Yes/No like the other eight, as requested
//    (BA clarification: its wording reads as a narrative prompt).
